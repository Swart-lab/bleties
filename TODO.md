To do list for BleTIES
======================

 - [ ] MILCOR - visualize correlations between IESs relative to distance
     - [x] Bin reads as "MIC" or "MAC" depending on per-read IES presence
     - [ ] Count telomeres on clipped-ends of MIC vs MAC reads
 - [ ] MILRAA - find suitable clustering and fuzzy matching parameters for
     PacBio subreads/CLR reads.
 - [ ] Implement Insert/Remove module, to remove putative IESs from assembly, or
     add them back in
 - [ ] MILTEL
     - [ ] Parse NCRF output
     - [ ] Assign CBS junction features
     - [ ] Clustering of putative CBS junctions
 - [x] Detailed docs in separate folder
 - [ ] Add license
