To do list for BleTIES
======================

 - [ ] MILCOR - visualize correlations between IESs relative to distance
     - [ ] Count telomeres on clipped-ends of MIC vs MAC reads
 - [x] Implement Insert/Remove module, to remove putative IESs from assembly, or
     add them back in
 - [ ] MILTEL
     - [ ] Map clipped segments back to assembly to look for rearrangements
     - [ ] Get average coverage of M operations at junctions, "breakage score"
         or "rearrangement score"
     - [ ] Parallelize NCRF code
 - [ ] Add license
