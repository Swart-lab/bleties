# To do list for MILRAA

 [x] Tidy and document code, make it more object-oriented
 [ ] Look for Ds that directly abut I inserts, as proxy for alternative excision boundaries?
 [x] Separate mapping count cutoffs for inserts and deletions
    - However should keep them high at first, because the cutoffs depend on read quality. If reads are noisy then this is GIGO
 [x] The HSM and MHS are not being reported at I insert junctions, because they are keyed by insert length 0
 [ ] Question: How many putative IES junctions are spanned by each read?
    - How "chimeric" is a given read? I.e. if a read contains non-excised IESs, does it have more non-excised IESs on average?
    - Per-read IES retention score - a measure of "linkage" between IES retention events
 [ ] Group putative IESs that are overlapping into clusters, to identify potential alternative excisions
 [x] Report inserted and deleted sequences that are putative IESs
 [x] Add ins_len to the BREAK_POINTS ID in GFF output
 [x] Use "dumb consensus" to get consensus inserted sequence for coverage > 10
 [ ] Implement Assembly module 
    - Will have to chop up the reads because PacBio reads are long, also want to include some of the context. 
    - Have to somehow deal with the potential mapping ambiguities at boundaries of inserts
 [ ] Implement MIRET (MILRET) module to report IES retention score
    [x] For each junction, report M operations spanning that junction -- Representing for IES- form
    [x] Also report D operations spanning that junction. If there are many D operations spanning that junction, something odd is going on!
    [x] Report I operations at that junction, of all insert lengths -- Representing IES+ form
    [ ] ? Report soft/hard clips that touch that junction (for completeness' sake)
    - Should provide a separate shortlist of IES breakpoints, which can be from MILRAA, but should not directly get the result from MILRAA. This is because user may already have a curated set of IES junctions and is just seeking a retention score calculation, vs. de novo prediction of IESs.
    - Should also report how many potential IESs are not in the provided shortlist.
    - ParTIES MIRET uses mapping to both MAC and MIC genomes to compare counts of reads spanning IES- version vs. reads spanning IES+ version. With PacBio reads, and known IES junctions, why don't we just rely on the Insert operation of the mapper? 
 [ ] Implement Insert/Remove module, to remove putative IESs from assembly, or add them back in
